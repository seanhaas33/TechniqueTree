          Technique Tree aims to change how athletes and coaches learn about their sport.
          With no financial or geographical limitations, information will be accessible to all.
          With its intuitive layout, it outperforms current video-sharing platforms.
          The tree-like display demonstrates which knowledge is essential for one's sport, and what
          they can subsequently learn. Users can see and evaluate their progress in various areas of
          their sport. A rating system, comments, and video replies will allow users to give their input
          and allow demonstrators to enhance usersâ€™ understanding of their content.
          Top athletes and coaches will have their own exclusive series. This could start with RPI athletes
          and expand as the user base grows. The site will start with specific athletes, and eventually,
          anybody will be able to create their own series. Whether coaches want to format their teachings to
          their team, or any individual wants their knowledge shared, it will be possible through Technique Tree.
